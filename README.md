# Fluent-Npp
Fluent-Npp takes the awesome dark theme from Visual Studio and brings it to Notepad++, it also includes a stylish touch with the addition of Mica effect. The main goal is to make switching between files in Visual Studio and Notepad++ seamless. 

This version is built on top of https://github.com/hellon8/VS2019-Dark-Npp, giving credit to the original version at https://github.com/SeanCline/Npp-VS2012-Dark.
